title: Types
---

The type definitions that follow strongly mimic [Figma's](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#files) existing data structures. 

It's the the best possible data structure for a node-based design system.

Plus, it'll be familiar and compatible with existing Figma Apps.

## Document

This is a document. You can see `Pages` on the left and `Variables` on the right.

A `Document` can have many `Pages`, this is so you can group your templates (ie. `Page`'s) in one place and also share `Variables` across them.

## Page

A `Page` is just one `Frame` and can be any size.

## Frame

A `Frame` is a node itself. Special only because it can hold children.

I've zoomed in a bit and hovered over the frame so you can see by the dashed lines.

Inside this `Frame` are `Rectangle`'s, `Vector`'s, and `Text`'s.

# Properties

A `Vector` is the core node of Rescene (or shape/layer  in the tool you use)

## Vector

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| width    |   Number    |     The width in px. |
| height    |   Number    |     The height in px. |
| opacity    |   Number    |     The opacity 0-1 (default 1) |
| rotation    |   Number    |     The rotation 0-2Ï€ (default 0) |
| strokeWeight    |   Number    |     The stroke weight in px. (default 0) |
| fills    |   Paint[]    |     An array of `Paint` objects. |
| strokes    |   Paint[]    |     An array of `Paint` objects. |

## Rectangle

I've selected a `Rectangle` here. Since it's selected you seen the selection indicator on the editor UI as well as the right settings panel which shows layer properties.

Uniquely customizable to a `Rectangle` is
| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| cornerRadius    |   Number    |     The corner radius in px. |

### Fun Fact
Images are just a `Rectangle` with a `fills[x]` type `IMAGE`. Any shape can hold images in `fills` like this.

<Image
  src="/images/docs/fyi-rect-zoomed-image.png"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

See! We added another `Paint` to `fills`: #68D89B. Fills are rendered from bottom to top just like in Figma.

## Ellipse

`Ellipse` has one unique property.
| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| arcData    |   ArcData    |     An ArcData object. |

## Polygon

Same as `Vector`

## ArcData

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| startingAngle    |   Number    |     Start of the sweep in radians. |
| endingAngle    |   Number    |     End of the sweep in radians. |
| innerRadius    |   Number    |     Inner radius value between 0 and 1. |

## Paint

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| type    |   String    |     One of 'IMAGE' or 'SOLID' |
| color    |   Number    |     A `Color` object. |
| imageUrl    |   String    |     The URL of the image. Can be a data url. The url **must** be accessible to our servers (ie public) |
| scaleMode    |   String    |     One of 'FILL', 'FIT', 'STRETCH', 'TILE' support eventually |
| imageTransform    |   String    |     A 2D affine transform matrix ex [[1,0,0],[0,1,0]] |

## Color

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| r    |   Number    |     The RED value between 0-1 |
| g    |   Number    |     The GREEN value between 0-1 |
