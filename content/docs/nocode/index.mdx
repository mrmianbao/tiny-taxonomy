title: No Code

As a `REST API` Rescene is supported by all no code platforms.

Currently, you'll need a bit more technical skill to set up an integration using Rescene as it requires
constructing an HTTP Request block, not just a **Rescene: Create Image** block.

However, you can expect official integrations soon for Zapier and Activepieces.
