Learn how to make *authenticated* requests to the Rescene API.

## API Keys

An API key gives the user access to the account it was created from.

### Generate an API Key

1. Login to your Rescene account.
2. Navigate to the [settings page](https://rescene.ai/settings) page.
3. Located the 'API Keys' section.
4. Click 'New API Key'

The new API Key should appear immediately. Copy this for the next steps.

### Using the API Key

You can now use the token to make requests to the Rescene API. You can do so by passing the token to the API in the X-Rescene-Token header of your request.

Here is an example in Node.js

```ts {2} title="node.js example" /appDir: true/
import superagent from "superagent"

const response = superagent
    .set('X-Rescene-Token', API_KEY)
    .get(BASE_URL)
```
