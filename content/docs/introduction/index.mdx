⚙️ Rescene is a **headless design tool**.

Our mission is to enable programmatic design by uniting the many design file formats into one *open-source* format based on [Figma's](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#files) existing data structures.

## Basics

There is the **Rescene App** and the **Rescene API**.

### The Rescene App

The Rescene App is a minimal editor very similar to Figma. It exists for you to import your designs, making them renderable on-demand via our API. You may also group them into Documents and Pages, assign variables that map to layer properties.

### The Rescene API

The Rescene API enables you to render any design (page) as a `svg`,`png`,`jpg`, or `pdf` on-demand with full customizability.

```ts {2} title="node.js example" /appDir: true/
import superagent from "superagent"

const response = superagent
    .set('X-Rescene-Token', API_KEY)
    .post(BASE_URL)
    .send({
        doc: "document_id",
        page: "page_id",
        // Variable values can map to many elements in a design
        variables: {
            bg_color: "#decade",
            title: "30% Off",
            image: "..some image url"
        },
        // If you're spicy you can override anything.
        overrides: {
            "node_id": {
                strokeWeight: 10,
                strokes: [
                    type: "SOLID",
                    color: {
                        r: 1,
                        g: 0.3,
                        b: 0.4,
                        a: 1
                    }
                ],
                fills: [
                    type: "SOLID",
                    color: {
                        r: 0.2,
                        g: 0.3,
                        b: 0.8,
                        a: 1
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    })

// Do something with the image
const imageBuffer = Buffer.from(response.body)
```
